    <h1>Daniel Barry, WEB140 - Course Contract</h1>
    <p>I, Daniel Barry, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024 WEB140-N801: Web Development with my instructor, Professor Ella McManus </p>

    <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
    
    <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
    
    <p>Signed: Daniel Barry, Sep 18, 2024</p>
